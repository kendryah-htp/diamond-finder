  <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
  <p class="updated">Last updated: February 20, 2026 &nbsp;·&nbsp; Effective immediately</p>

  <p>These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of Diamond Finder™, operated by ELVT Social ("Company," "we," "us"). By accessing or using Diamond Finder™, you agree to be bound by these Terms.</p>

  <h2>1. The Service</h2>
  <p>Diamond Finder™ is a SaaS platform that provides a gamified website engagement tool ("vault widget") that can be embedded on third-party websites. The service includes an admin dashboard, embed code generator, demo access, and related features.</p>

  <h2>2. Account Registration</h2>
  <p>To use the full service, you must create an account with a valid email address and password. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your credentials and for all activity under your account. You must be at least 18 years old to create an account.</p>

  <h2>3. Subscription & Billing</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Diamond Finder™ is offered on a subscription basis billed monthly</li>
    <li>Subscriptions automatically renew unless cancelled before the renewal date</li>
    <li>All prices are in USD and subject to change with 30 days notice</li>
    <li>Payment is processed securely by Stripe</li>
    <li>Promotional codes (including DIAMOND20) are subject to availability and may be withdrawn at any time</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Acceptable Use</h2>
  <p>You agree not to use Diamond Finder™ to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Collect emails or data without proper consent from your website visitors</li>
    <li>Misrepresent the nature of your offer or vault contents</li>
    <li>Spam, harass, or send unsolicited communications</li>
    <li>Violate any applicable laws or regulations, including CAN-SPAM, GDPR, or CCPA</li>
    <li>Reverse engineer, copy, or resell the platform without written permission</li>
    <li>Embed the vault on websites promoting illegal, harmful, or fraudulent content</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. White-Label & Reseller Use</h2>
  <p>Agency plan subscribers may use Diamond Finder™ to serve multiple client websites. Resellers are responsible for ensuring their clients comply with these Terms. Sub-licensing or reselling access to the platform itself (not the vault widget) requires a separate written agreement with ELVT Social.</p>

  <h2>6. Intellectual Property</h2>
  <p>Diamond Finder™, the vault widget, admin dashboard, and all associated code, design, and branding are the intellectual property of ELVT Social. Your subscription grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use the service. You retain ownership of your vault content and any leads you collect.</p>

  <h2>7. Data & Privacy</h2>
  <p>Your use of Diamond Finder™ is also governed by our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>. You are responsible for maintaining your own privacy policy on any website where you embed the vault widget and for obtaining appropriate consent from your visitors.</p>

  <h2>8. Uptime & Service Availability</h2>
  <p>We strive for maximum uptime but do not guarantee uninterrupted service. Scheduled maintenance, third-party outages (Supabase, Stripe, Resend), or circumstances beyond our control may result in temporary unavailability. We are not liable for losses resulting from service interruptions.</p>

  <h2>9. Limitation of Liability</h2>
  <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, ELVT Social shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, including loss of revenue, data, or business opportunities, arising from your use of Diamond Finder™. Our total liability shall not exceed the amount you paid us in the 3 months preceding the claim.</p>

  <h2>10. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
  <p>Diamond Finder™ is provided "as is" and "as available" without warranties of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement.</p>

  <h2>11. Termination</h2>
  <p>We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your account for violation of these Terms, with or without notice. You may cancel your subscription at any time through your billing portal. Upon termination, your vault will be deactivated and your data retained for 30 days before deletion.</p>

  <h2>12. Governing Law</h2>
  <p>These Terms shall be governed by the laws of the United States. Any disputes shall be resolved through binding arbitration in accordance with the American Arbitration Association rules, unless prohibited by applicable law.</p>

  <h2>13. Changes to Terms</h2>
  <p>We may update these Terms at any time. We will notify you of material changes via email or by posting a notice on our website. Continued use of the service after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.</p>
